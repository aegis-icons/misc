## Generic icons

In December 2022, aegis-icons introducted redesigned set of generic icons (based of [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)), with new background color that fits better for modern Android. These icons have been given more thought to symbol size, clarity, uniformity and style. In addition, seven new generic icons were released. [Reasons for redesign can be found from here](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/issues/722).

## Removal of "unregulated (crypto) currency trading / investing platforms" related icons

In May 2023, aegis-icons banned requests and submissions of any unregulated currency trading / investing platforms. In the summer 2023, the current icons were checked and icons based of unregulated platforms were removed from the pack.

This is controversal and admittedly @[krisu5](https://github.com/krisu5)'s personal decision (don't like most crypto invest companies), but there's proper reasons too:

1. Too many requests for these platforms and high maintenance for it.
2. So many of these platforms are scams / frauds or do money laundering
   - See: [FTX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX#Legal_process), [Celsius](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mitchellmartin/2023/01/05/celsius-founder-mashinsky-hit-with-fraud-suit-by-new-york-state/), [Samtrade FX](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/online-trading-platform-samtrade-fx-under-probe-by-police-mas-3-arrested), [Vauld](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/12/india-seizes-46-million-from-crypto-exchange-vauld-in-money-laundering-probe/) etc.
3. Checking regulation is the only way to *somewhat* certainly say of the legality of the company.

If we want only icons of truly trustworthy services, then this decision was necessary. Exceptions do occur for other kind of services too, but those are easier to handle in my opinion.

**Reminder:** we are not only source for the icons and not associated with Beem Development, the developers of Aegis. You can download images from the net and use them as icons, create yourself or use one of the many generic icons from our pack. You can even create your own icon pack if you want to.
